Hi there!

This is an automated email from WriteIdeally (but don't worry, <%= @invitation[:user].email %> let us know your email address and asked us to send you this email!) - this isn't spam.

The reason they asked us to email you is so that you could have a chance to join them on WriteIdeally - an online tool for managing your ideas as an author - which, presumably you are (or are thinking of becoming), with the aim of removing the distraction of having to keep all your notes organized.

Here are some of the things WriteIdeally can help you with:
- Too many post-it notes: using WriteIdeally, you can come back later and change an idea you've had, or even remove it entirely - even better, all of your ideas are kept in a nice tidy list that you can browse, or search.
- 'What was this for again...?': all of your WriteIdeally ideas can be 'tagged' with keywords - this means that (apart from making things really easy to find), you can get a bit of a prompt to jog your memory if you've just jotted down a short idea.
- Losing or accidently deleting documents and pieces of paper (We all do it): WriteIdeally is online, and so are your ideas. This means that you can get to them anywhere with internet access, and they are are safe and secure.

Does this sound like something you might be interested in? If it is, head over to our signup page (http://www.writeideally.com//users/sign_up) to get started. If it isn't, that's fine - it was nice meeting you, and you won't hear from us again (We would hate to hassle you!)

Have a great day!
